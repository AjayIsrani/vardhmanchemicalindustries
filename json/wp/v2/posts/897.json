In some cases, they have punch lists that are pages long.

Absolutely, says Marnie Oursler, owner of Marnie Custom Homes in Bethany Beach, Del., and host of DIY Network\u2019s Big Beach Builds.<\/p>\n<p>Ensuring your home is built to the highest standards and that you won\u2019t have any major repairs to deal with soon after moving in comes down to the things you do before purchasing a home, says Oursler. Before signing any contracts, research the homebuilders you are interested in working with to gauge customer satisfaction. And, don\u2019t be afraid to ask builders questions.<\/p>\n<p>Oursler suggests speaking with past clients to see how satisfied they are with their home and how the builder dealt with any changes or repairs. \u201cThat\u2019s going to give you a lot of good insight,\u201d Oursler says. \u201cNo process is going to be smooth the entire way. You have to trust and know the builder.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the 10 years that Wendy Arriz has been a real estate agent in New York City, she\u2019s seen some of the best, selling ultraluxe new-construction homes, as well as lower-priced properties.
